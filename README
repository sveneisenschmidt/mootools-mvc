[Thank You]
I would like to thank the guys behind MooTools and Zend Framework for the awesome job they did in
giving us such great frameworks.


[Running the provided example]

For running the example provided in the folder ./example you need to point
a running Apache instance (localhost) to the example folder (i.e. http://localhost/mootools-mvc/example/).
The Apache needs to have PHP installed and in httpd.conf or your virtual hosts the property  'AllowOverride'
should be set to all.
